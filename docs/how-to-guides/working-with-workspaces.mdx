## What are Workspaces?
Every Webiny project is organized as a [monorepo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/monorepos). This essentially means your project is organized as a collection of multiple NPM packages or sometimes called workspaces.

Behind the scenes, it is the [yarn 2](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager that enables this organization, via its [workspaces feature](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces):

> The Yarn workspaces aim to make working with monorepos easy, solving one of the main use cases for yarn link in a more declarative way. In short, they allow multiple of your projects to live together in the same repository AND to cross-reference each others - any modification to one's source code being instantly applied to the others.

So, in context of yarn 2, every package in a monorepo is a workspace. The list of all workspaces can be found in the `package.json` file, located in your project root, for example:

```
(...)
"workspaces": {
    "packages": [
        "packages/*",
        "apps/admin/code",
        "apps/website/code",
        "apps/theme",
        "api/code/fileManager/*",
        "api/code/graphql",
        "api/code/getTime",
        "api/code/headlessCMS",
        "api/code/pageBuilder/*",
        "api/code/prerenderingService/render",
        "api/code/prerenderingService/flush",
        "api/code/prerenderingService/queue/*"
    ]
},
(...)
```

In addition to the shown list, you're free to add more workspaces, if need be.

## How To Work With Workspaces?

Webiny CLI exposes a single `yarn webiny workspaces` (or `yarn webiny ws` for short) command that enables you to work with multiple workspaces at once. The common use case where this might be needed is local development, where you want to watch for code changes on multiple packages, and rebuild them accordingly.

In order to establish a watch session across multiple packages, you can run the following command:

```
yarn webiny ws run watch --scope {scope} --folder {folder}
```
