## Project Development

This section explains different workflows and approaches that you may want to incorporate into your project development process.

Have in mind that project development process doesn't just assume writing code. This process always involves many other subprocesses, which are equally if not more important. Some of the subprocesses are:

- working in teams
- branching strategies
- deployments
- CI/CD
- monitoring and observability
- system backups
