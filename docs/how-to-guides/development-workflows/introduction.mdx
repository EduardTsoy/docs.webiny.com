## Project Development

The **Development Workflows** section explains different workflows and approaches that you may want to incorporate into your project development process.

It's important to know that the project development process doesn't just entail writing code. It also involves many other subprocesses, which are equally if not more important, for example:

- code branching strategies
- teams organization
- testing
- continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)
- security
- monitoring and observability
- system backups

Knowing how these processes work and how to set them up can make a significant impact on the success of the project you're working on.

The workflows and approaches we cover in the following sections may not always work for you. But, they do represent a solid foundation on which you can expand on if need be.
