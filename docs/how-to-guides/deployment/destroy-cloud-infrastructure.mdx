<!-- ## The `destroy` command

To make it a bit easier for users that are just testing Webiny or want to quickly destroy all of the deployed cloud infrastructure, Webiny CLI provides the `destroy` command, which destroys all of the cloud infrastructure, deployed by the three applications that are by default included in a Webiny project.

To destroy all deployed cloud infrastructure, in your terminal of choice, and in your project root, execute the following command:

```
yarn webiny destroy
```

:::danger
Although this may seem as a convenient way to get rid of everything that was previously deployed, be cautious when using this command. Once cloud infrastructure is destroyed, in most cases, it cannot be brought back, which means you could potentially loose your data, files, and similar.
:::

### Different environments
The `destroy` command destroys the cloud infrastructure that was deployed into the `dev` environment by default. You can specify a different environment with the `--env` argument. For example, to destroy cloud infrastructure that was deployed into the `prod` environment, you can run the following command:

```
yarn webiny destroy --env prod
```
-->

## The `app destroy` command

This command lets you destroy cloud infrastructure previously deployed by a single project application. <!-- This can be handy if you want to avoid completely destroying all cloud infrastructure that was deployed by the default project applications, which is what the shown `destroy` command does. -->

As its first argument, the `app destroy` command receives the path to the project application folder. You also need to specify the environment in which the cloud infrastructure was previously deployed, which is specified via the `--env` argument.

<!-- Note that, unlike with the `destroy` command, the `--env` argument is not optional and it needs to be provided explicitly. -->

The following destroy commands destroy cloud infrastructure deployed for three project applications, all previously deployed into the `dev` environment:

```
yarn webiny app destroy api --env dev
yarn webiny app destroy apps/admin --env dev
yarn webiny app destroy apps/website --env dev
```
