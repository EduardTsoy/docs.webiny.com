## Introduction

Deploying our project multiple environments enables us to preview and test new features and bug fixes, before actually rolling them out to real users. This helps us in making our project as stable as possible, and, ultimately, providing the best possible user experience.

## Multiple Environments and Extra Costs

When we talk about multiple environment deployments, it's important to note that we're talking about deploying multiple copies of our project, both in terms of the application code and, more importantly, needed cloud infrastructure resources.

Serverless technologies and services have many advantages, one of them being the **pay-per-use** pricing model. This means that, if we, for example, had five environments deployed into our AWS account, and none of them were used (or very rarely), no additional cost would be incurred.

This **pay-per-use** pricing model, paired with Webiny's built-in deployment workflows and tools, makes it much more affordable and easier to introduce multiple environments for your project.

:::caution Non-Serverless Resources
Take into consideration that sometimes, projects do require cloud infrastructure resources that aren't serverless or do not follow the pay-per-use pricing model. In that case, having multiple environments could in fact incur additional cost.

In Webiny's case and its default setup, one of the resources of that kind is the [Amazon Elastic Search](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/pricing/).

## Shared and Isolated Environments

There are two types of environments that we usually deploy: **shared** and **isolated**.

**Shared environments** are environments that are shared among:

- the team - for development, integration, and testing needs
- real users - a unique environment, most commonly known as the **production** environment

In terms of naming these environments, a strict rule does not exist, but some of the typical environment names for these environments are usually `dev`, `staging`, and `prod` (`production`). These are always deployed from a CI/CD environment.

On the other hand, **isolated environments** are environments that are deployed by developers, for their own development and testing needs. These are usually deployed and destroyed from a developer's machine.

### Long-lived and Short-lived Environments

Shared environments are long-lived environments, meaning, once they're deployed, they do not get destroyed that often, if ever. In contrast, isolated environments are short-lived - they are frequently deployed and destroyed.

:::caution
Be sure to check for unused deployed cloud infrastructure resources from time to time. We want to avoid unnecessary cost from mentioned non-serverless resources, that do not follow the pay-per-use pricing model.

## Organization

The following diagram shows the most common organization of shared and isolated environments in a single project:

The environments shown actually mirror the branches in your Git repository. More on this in the Branching guide.

### Shared environments
Although there can more shared environments, most commonly, we end up with the following:

#### `dev`

New fixes and features are first deployed into this environment, might be unstable from time to time.

#### `staging`

For testing new release candidates in a production-like environment. This environment has to reach a state that can be considered as stable, before deploying to **production**

#### `production`
A system used by real users. Must be in a state that is considered as stable, as much of the time as possible.

### Isolated environments

With shared environments, developers deploy their own environments, where, as mentioned, they develop and test bug fixes and new feature. Usually, one environment per developer is enough. If the environment is not needed anymore, it's recommended it's destroyed.


## AWS Accounts

In terms of AWS accounts, the usual practice is for each shared environment and developer to have its own AWS account. For easier management, we recommend checking out [AWS Organisations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/):

> AWS Organizations helps you centrally manage and govern your environment as you grow and scale your AWS resources.

As mentioned, the shared environment AWS accounts will mostly be used from your CI/CD pipeline, which we cover in the next section.
