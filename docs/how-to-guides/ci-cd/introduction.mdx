## What is CI/CD?

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. While automated testing is not strictly part of CI it is typically implied.

**Continuous deployment (CD)** is a software development practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production.

Note that the **CD** abbreviation can also stand for **continuous delivery**, which also entails continuous deployment of your project, only in a [more manual fashion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery):

> Continuous delivery is the ability to deliver software that can be deployed at any time through manual releases; this is in contrast to continuous deployment which uses automated deployments.

In the rest of this guide, when mentioning the **CI** abbreviation, we're explicitly referring to the **continuous deployment**.

## The Workflow

CI/CD process can be splat into a couple of subprocesses. Knowing how these processes work and how to set them up can make a significant impact on the success of the project you're working on.

## Introduction

This section explains different workflows and approaches that you may want to incorporate into your project's CI/CD process.

It's important to know that the project development doesn't just entail writing code. It also involves many other subprocesses, which are equally if not more important.
