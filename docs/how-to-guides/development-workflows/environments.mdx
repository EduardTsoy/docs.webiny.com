## Introduction

Deploying your project into multiple environments is certainly an approach you want to adopt.

Having multiple environments enables us to preview and test new features and bug fixes, before actually deploying them to real users. Ultimately, this helps us in providing the best possible experience for our users.

## Multiple Environments and Extra Costs

When we talk about multiple environment deployments, it's important to note that we're basically talking about deploying multiple copies of our project, both in terms of our application code and, more importantly, needed cloud infrastructure resources.

Serverless technologies and services have many advantages, one of them being the **pay-per-use** pricing model. This means that, if we, for example, had five environments deployed into our AWS account, and they were not used, no additional cost would be incurred.

This **pay-per-use** pricing model, paired with Webiny's built-in deployment workflows and tools, makes it much more affordable and easier to introduce multiple environments for your project.

:::caution Non-Serverless Resources
Take into consideration that sometimes, projects do require cloud infrastructure resources that aren't serverless or do not follow the pay-per-use pricing model. In that case, having multiple environments could in fact incur additional cost.

In Webiny's case and its default setup, one of the resources of that kind is the [Amazon Elastic Search](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/pricing/). Read more about the cloud infrastructure resources that get deployed into your AWS account in our [Cloud Infrastructure](/docs/key-topics/cloud-infrastructure/introduction) key topics section.

## Organization

As stated in the introduction, we want to have our project deployed into multiple environments. Some of the will be shared with the team, and the rest will be isolated environments that are only used by a single developer.

These multiple environments can be shared by your team, but also isolated, or in other words, only for a particular developer.

The environments can the following:

- **dev** - an environment shared by the team, is shared by the team, this is where the latest development changes are deployed and tested end-to-end. This environment is unstable by nature, and shouldn’t be used by other teams.
- staging should closely resemble production, and would often contain dumps of production data. This is where you can stress test your release candidate in a production-like environment.
- production and then there’s production
